# Arduino-I2C

This project is created to modify an Intel chip's hex file using the I2C protocol with the use of an Arduino and a C# interface. By doing this, we eliminate the need to use Intel's adapter and is able to create our own version of the editor that can be integrated into automation projects, such as reading the serial number of the chip during a series of tests. The simplifed editor also ensures less room for error when tests are being set up by a technician.

Some addresses the code is written to and the default settings of the hex files have been modified to protect private information.
